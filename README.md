# Echoes of the Past
This repository contains the source code for a small prototype developed in 4 days for Game Off Jam 2025 under the theme “Wave.”

The core mechanic revolves around the Echo system, which temporarily stops time and spawns a Ghost that replays your previously recorded actions. This creates a loop of movement waves:
record → echo → repeat.

The prototype includes:

A single puzzle level

Time-stop Echo mechanic

Ghost that replays recorded movements

Ability to override recordings at any moment

Basic 2D platforming controls

This project is not a full game — it’s a mechanic showcase exploring temporal “wave” repetition.
